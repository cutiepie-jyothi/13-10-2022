	<p class="Uppalapati">Uppalapati Venkata Suryanarayana Prabhas Raju (born 23 October 1979), known mononymously as Prabhas ([pɾabʱaːs]), is an Indian actor who works predominantly in Telugu cinema. One of the highest-paid actors in India,[4] Prabhas has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2015 based on his income and popularity.[5][6][7] He has received seven Filmfare Awards South nominations, a Nandi Award, a SIIMA Award, and is the first South Indian actor to receive a wax sculpture at Madame Tussaud's wax museum.[8]

Prabhas made his acting debut in 2002 with Eeswar, but attained his breakthrough with the romantic action film Varsham (2004). His notable works include Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Ek Niranjan (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), with his performance in the lattermost earning him the state Nandi Award for Best Actor.[9][10] In 2015, Prabhas starred in the title role in S. S. Rajamouli's epic action film Baahubali: The Beginning, which is the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film of all time. He later reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over ₹1,000 crore (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days, and is the second highest-grossing Indian film of all time. The pan-India success of the Baahubali franchise helped Prabhas achieve nationwide recognition. He then starred in Saaho (2019), which collected over ₹439 crore.

In addition to his acting career, Prabhas is a known philanthropist, who aided the public greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic and adopted 1650 acres of land in Khaizipally Reserve Forest among supporting other causes. He is also the brand ambassador for the Mahindra TUV300.
Prabhas started his movie career with Eeswar in 2002. In 2003, he was the lead in Raghavendra. In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu. In 2005, he appeared in Chakram and in the film Chatrapathi, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, in which he portrays the role of a refugee, exploited by goons. It had a 100-day run in 54 centers.[16] Idlebrain.com stated that he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence.[17] Later he acted in Pournami, Yogi and Munna, an action-drama film came out in 2007, followed by the action-comedy Bujjigadu in 2008. In 2009 his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa stylish and visually rich.[18]

In 2010 he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling. The film opened to positive reviews. The Times of India gave a two and half star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a Gen Z lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[19] In 2011, he appeared in Mr. Perfect, another romantic comedy. The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.[20]

2012–2014: Continued career
In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in content".[21] Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of Prabhas."[22] Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie one and half stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."[23] He rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[24]

In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episode which occupies 100% of second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[25] Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the Box Office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[26] Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[27] Super good movies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both Class and Mass. It is a worth watch."[28] Prabhas made his Hindi cinema debut in 2014 by doing a cameo role in the item number "Punjabi Mast" from the film Action Jackson.[29]

In the media
Prabhas is often referred as "Darling" or "Pan-India star".[52] He was ranked second in Times' Most Desirable Men for the year 2017,[53] and twelfth in 2018.[54] He was then added to the Forever Desirable list of Hyderabad Times in 2019.[55][56] He was the most searched actor on Google in Karnataka, for the year 2019.[57] He is the only actor from south cinema to feature in the magazine Eastern Eye's 2019 listing of the 10 Sexiest Asian Men.[58][59] He was also featured in the GQ in their listing of the most influential young Indians of 2017.[60] In 2021, he has been named the ‘Most Handsome Asian Male’ in the Fancy Odds annual list.[61]

Pooja Dhar of Pinkvilla cited him as "one of the most humble and down to earth Indian actors" in her article.[62] In September 2020, Prabhas adopted 1650 acres of land in Khazipally Reserve Forest, and made additional donations for the development of the eco-park in the name of his late father.[63]

Originally Answered: What is the amazing fact of Bhutan?
The biggest gift that we are blessed with is, His Majesty The King. He is truly the peoples` king. Since a few days, the drastic heavy monsoon rain has created landslides, roadblocks or floods in Bhutan. So many houses were destroyed and shops were carried away by floods. It has affected badly, especially in the southern regions of Bhutan.
Whenever people are into trouble, our King will be there to support us. We the Bhutanese are innumerably blessed to have a King in our lives. His Majesty`s goodness is our happiness. Our trouble is his distress. He is rich in comfort.

What are some interesting facts about Joseph Stalin?
Stalin was born with a birth defect. The second and third toes of his left foot were webbed and he was so insecure about it that when his feet were later being examined by his Kremlin doctors, he hid the rest of his body—and his face—under a blanket.
He suffered from smallpox as a child and had pockmarks because of it. One of his nicknames—and an Okhrana (Tsarist secret police that hunted revolutionaries) code name for him—would be “Chopura” (the Pockmarked). As a dictator, he had his pockmarks powdered by his bodyguards and removed from the official photos.
Both of his parents beat him merciles

Why does "Powerstar" Pawan Kalyan have craziest fan following in Andhra Pradesh?
Why I admire Pawan kalyan:

I admire two kinds of people

The persons with SAME PERSPECTIVE AS MINE. Yeah, Iam selfish, I really love “reflection of my character” in others
Persons who have traits I always wanted to have, but couldn’t.
I agree that PK is a amateur actor and couldn’t fit in all types of characters

I also agree that there are many actors in tollywood who can act,dance,fight way better than PK.

Love and admiration are always intuitions. If you find some reason in loving others, you will always find a reason to hate them too….

These are the reasons why I like PK

Attitude: I will narrate the

Originally Answered: Do you know any interesting facts?
Ever wondered why there are revolving doors at the entrances of big buildings?

Appears to be trouble during excessive movement of people…isn’t it??


Well there is a reason for that bulky thing to get installed at the entrances.

Revolving doors allow better control of the inside temperature compared to the regular sliding or hinged doors.

Opening a hinged or sliding door even for a brief period will result in tremendous amount of heat exchange between the internal and external temperatures, especially in extreme weather conditions.

A revolving door prevents this energy loss as there is never a point

What is the most interesting scientific fact?
Our brain thinks on the Logarithmic Scale, instead of the additive scale. This means that our brain thinks in proportions instead of differences.

Thus, we subconsciously believe that the difference between 2 and 1 is greater than the difference between 3 and 2 and so on...


The first scale here is the logarithmic scale while the second one is the commonly used additive scale.

It comes in handy in most practical life situations but sometimes, it causes some problems too.

Take a look at the following scenarios


Case 1: There is one tiger in front of you.
Case 2: There are two tigers in front of you.
